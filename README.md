Real Time Big Data Analytics Summer 2018 - Project

Quantifying Relationship between Blockchain news and Cryptocurrency Prices
● Built an application using Hadoop MapReduce, Hive Analytics and Natural Language Processing to find the correlation
between Bitcoin cryptocurrency prices and sentiment scores of news articles published in financial journals like Financial Times, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.
● With a Pearson score of 0.58, our analysis justified the majority of anomalies seen in the Bitcoin price volatility. Also verified our hypothesis of a positive correlation with transaction volumes and the news sentiment scores.
